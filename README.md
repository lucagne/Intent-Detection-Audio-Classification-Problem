# Intent-Detection-Audio-Classification-Problem
Classification of the intent expressed by the speakers between a limited set of labels, using Random Forest Classifiers and Support Vector Machine Classifiers
 
Intent detection is a crucial task in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. In this project, we took a dataset consisting of a collection of WAV audio file, expressing the intent of a user, like asking to increase the volume. To solve it, we used and compare classical ML algorithms, in particular using Support Vector Machine Classifiers and Random Forests, achieveing a satisfying accuracy given that no Neural Network was used

This project was done for the Data Science Lab: process and methodse, taught by Prof. [Elena Baralis](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=elena.baralis), in collaboration with my colleague [Flavio Spuri](https://github.com/Flavios3)
